# Overview

This program is to assist me with solidifying my knowledge in all programming languages. Kotlin is very similar Java, so I wanted to learn more about the differences and similarities. I came to know that there were a lot more similarities than differences. 

I wrote a very basic calculator. The user inputs 3 separate values, two numbers and an operator. If anything else is inputted, the program asks again for the correct input.

The reason I chose a calculator is because i have been very good at math, and I wanted to see if I could create a program that can handle several equations.

# Development Environment

Whenever possible, I tend to avoid AI to write my program entirely, but rather I used AI to debug or come up with ideas to enhance my code further. Each line is written by me, but partly inspired elsewhere.
I did not use any libraries besides the Math library for the exponent values.

# Future Work

Here are some improvements I can make to my program later on. 

- Compress the program to display text on a single line. Meaning you don't need to input 3 separate values separately, but rather on a single line and use a separate function to separate the values
- Create more operators
- Solve for X in an equation
